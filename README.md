# 💳 Paran Olacak – Frontend

Paran Olacak is the frontend of a modern banking system website.  
It provides users with an intuitive and responsive interface to manage their accounts, transactions, and financial activities.  

This project is built with **Vue.js**, **TypeScript**, and **SCSS**, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and clean UI design.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** – Progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces  
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed language that compiles to JavaScript  
- **SCSS (Sass)** – CSS preprocessor for cleaner and reusable styles  
- **Vite** *(optional: if you used it)* – Fast development server and build tool
